# OccupAI

**Real-time occupancy intelligence for physical spaces.**

OccupAI turns your existing security cameras into a powerful business intelligence system — with no video ever leaving your premises.

## What We Do

We help venue operators make smarter decisions about staffing, marketing, and operations by providing real-time insights into how your spaces are being used.

**Perfect for:**
- **Restaurants & Bars** — Optimize table turns, bar coverage, and patio seating
- **Retail Stores** — Understand foot traffic patterns and peak shopping times
- **Gyms & Studios** — Monitor class attendance and equipment usage
- **Event Venues** — Track crowd flow and capacity in real-time

## How It Works
```

1. **Plug in our edge device** to your existing camera system (no technical expertise needed)

4. **Get actionable insights** through real-time analytics and AI-powered recommendations
